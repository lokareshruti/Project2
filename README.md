# 🏦 Loan Prediction App Using Machine Learning
# 📌 Introduction
In today's fast-paced digital economy, financial institutions are turning to machine learning to streamline their loan approval processes. Traditional loan assessments are time-consuming, often biased, and require extensive manual intervention. A Loan Prediction App uses machine learning models to predict whether a loan should be approved or denied, based on various applicant details such as income, employment status, credit history, and more.

The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive system that accurately classifies loan applications as “Approved” or “Not Approved” using historical data and machine learning algorithms.

# 📊 Dataset Overview

# ✅ Conclusion
The Loan Prediction App significantly reduces the workload of bank officials by automating initial screening of loan applications. It ensures faster, more consistent, and data-driven decisions. With future improvements like integrating real-time credit scores or additional financial parameters, the accuracy and reliability of the predictions can be further enhanced
